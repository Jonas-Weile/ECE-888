This is a blog about **Causal Inference** - specifically, I will use this blog to showcase my work and experiments within this area. At this time, I am about to embark on <u>my very first project related to Causal Inference!</u> I will continually create new blog posts as I work through the project, using each individual blog posts to describe a specific stage of the project. In total, I expect the project to span 5 differet blog posts (i.e. consist of 5 different stages), as outlined below:

1. [Problem Definition](/ece-888/project1/2022/10/05/problem-definition)
2. Identification of Causal Effects
3. Estimation of Causal Effects
4. Sensitivity Analysis
5. Conclusion

## About me
I am first year master student at the Technial University of Denmark, currently on an exchange at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

My background is mostly within *algorithms* and *logic-based artificial intelligence*, but with a strong interest in *machine learning*. I want to learn more about causal inference and be able to formalize causation - with an end goal of applying a causal inference framework to machine learning problems.
