This is a blog about **Causal Inference**. The blog will showcase my work and experiments within this area, and will be updated with blog posts as I work with more projects.

## About me
I am first year master student at the Technial University of Denmark, currently on an exchange at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

My background is mostly within *algorithms* and *logic-based artificial intelligence*, but with a strong interest in *machine learning*. I want to learn more about causal inference and be able to formalize causation - with an end goal of applying a causal inference framework to machine learning problems.
